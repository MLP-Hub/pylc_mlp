## Overview

The PyLC (Python Landscape Classifier) is a Pytorch-based trainable segmentation network and land cover classification tool for oblique landscape photography. PyLC was developed for the land cover classification of high-resolution grayscale and colour oblique mountain photographs. The training dataset is sampled from the [Mountain Legacy Project](http://mountainlegacy.ca/) repeat photography collection hosted at the [University of Victoria](https://uvic.ca/).

The Deeplab implementation was adapted from [Jianfeng Zhang, Vision & Machine Learning Lab, National University of Singapore, Deeplab V3+ in PyTorch](https://github.com/jfzhang95/pytorch-deeplab-xception). The U-Net implementation was adapted from [Xiao Cheng](https://github.com/xiaochengcike/pytorch-unet-1).

PyTorch implementation of Deeplab: This is a PyTorch(0.4.1) implementation of DeepLab-V3-Plus. It can use Modified Aligned Xception and ResNet as backbone.

### Mountain Legacy Project (MLP)

 The [Mountain Legacy Project](http://mountainlegacy.ca/) supports numerous research initiatives exploring the use of repeat photography to study ecosystem, landscape, and anthropogenic changes. MLP hosts the largest systematic collection of mountain photographs, with over 120,000 high-resolution historic (grayscale) survey photographs of Canadaâ€™s Western mountains captured from the 1880s through the 1950s, with over 9,000 corresponding modern (colour) repeat images. Over the years, the MLP has built a suite of custom tools for the classification and analysis of images in the collection (Gat et al. 2011; Jean et al. 2015b; Sanseverino et al. 2016).

### Implementation

PyLC uses deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) trained on high-resolution, grayscale and colour landscape photography from the MLP collection, specifically optimized for the segmentation of oblique mountain landscapes. This package uses [U-net](ref-3) and [Deeplabv3+](#ref-4) segmentation models with a ResNet101 pretrained encoder, as well as a fully-connected [conditional random fields model](#ref-5) used to boost segmentation accuracy.

### Features

- Allows for classification of high-resolution oblique landscape images
- Uses multi-loss (weighted cross-entropy, Dice, Focal) to address semantic class imbalance
- Uses threshold-based data augmentation designed to improve classification of low-frequency classes
- Applies optional Conditional Random Fields (CRF) filter to boost segmentation accuracy

## Requirements (Python 3.10+)

## Usage

The PyLC (Python Landscape Classifier) classification tool has three main run modes:

1. Data Preprocessing;
 - Extraction: To generate training and validation databases.
 - Profiling: To profile the semantic class distribution of a dataset.
 - Data Augmentation: To extend dataset.
2. Model Training: Train or retrain segmentation networks.
3. Model Testing: Generate segmentation maps.

Default parameters are defined in `config.py`. Categorization schemas (i.e. class labels) are defined in separate JSON files in the local `/schemas` folder. Two examples are provided: `schema_a.json` and `schema_anthro.json`, which adds the anthropogenic class.

### 1. Preprocessing

This package offers configurable preprocessing utilities to prepare raw input data for model training. Input images must be either JPG or TIF format, and masks PNG format. The image filename must match its mask filename (e.g. img_01.tif and msk_01.png). You can download the original image/mask dataset(s) (see repository links under Datasets section) and save to a local directory for model training and testing.

#### 1.1 Extraction

Extraction is a preprocessing step to create usable data to train segmentation network models. Tile extraction is used to partition raw high-resolution source images and masks into smaller square image tiles that can be used in memory. Images are by default scaled by factors of 0.2, 0.5 and 1.0 before tiling to improve scale invariance. Image data is saved to HDF5 binary data format for fast loading. Mask data is also profiled for analysis and data augmentation. See parameters for dimensions and stride. Extracted tiles can be augmented using data augmentation processing.

To create an extraction database from raw images and masks, provide separacte images and masks directory paths. Each image file in the directory must have a corresponding mask file that shares the same file name and use allowed image formats (see above).

Note that the generated database file is saved to `data/db/` in the project root.

##### Options:

- `--img <path>`: (Required) Path to images directory.
- `--mask <path>`: (Required) Path to masks directory.
- `--schema <path>`: (Default: `./schemas/schema_a.json`) Path to JSON categorization schema file.
- `--ch <int>`: (Required) Number of image channels. RGB: 3 (default), Grayscale: 1.
- `--scale <int>`: Apply image scaling before extraction.

```
% python pylc.py extract --ch [number of channels] --img [path/to/image(s)] --mask [path/to/mask(s)]
```

#### 1.3 Data Augmentation

Data augmentation can improve the balance of pixel class distribution in a database by extending the dataset with altered copies of samples composed of less-represented semantic classes. This package uses a novel self-optimizing thresholding algorithm applied to the class distribution of each tile to compute a sampling rate for that tile.

Note that the generated augmented database is saved to `data/db/` in the project root.

##### Options:

- `--db <path>`: (Required) Path to source database file.

```
% python pylc.py augment --db [path/to/database.h5]
```

### 2.0 Training

Training or retraining a model requires an extraction or augmented database generated using the preprocessing steps above. Model training is CUDA-enabled. Note that other training hyperparamters can be set in the `config.py` configuration file. Note that files generated for best models and checkpoints (`.pth`), as well as loss logs (`.npy`), are saved to `./data/save/` in a folder labeled by the model ID.

```

## SLURM Usage (Digital Resource Alliance of Canada)
The `scripts_slurm` directory contains scripts to run PyLC using the SLURM batch management software used by Digital Resource Alliance of Canada. Within each script the corresponding python execution is called, with the same options (file paths, etc.) as the usage description above. To us a script first modify the contents to specify the desired options in the python call. The scripts should be run one at a time (each one depends on output from the previous) in the same order as the usage above, namely:
- `sbatch extract_slurm.sh`
- `sbatch augment_slurm.sh`
- `sbatch train_slurm.sh`
- `sbatch test_slurm.sh`
